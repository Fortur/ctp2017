                        48 largest Russian companies (5 %) meet modern requirements for transparency adopted by the
                        global business community (Premium, I and II levels of transparency).
                    </a>
                </li>
                <p>117 companies fully disclosed the reporting information using both main international standards: the
                    “Guide to Global Reporting Initiative GRI” and the International Integrated Reporting Framework.
                </p>
                <p>16 companies used independent verification of reported non-financial information (verification of
                    financial information is required for all companies).
                </p>
                <p>15 companies tried to fully satisfy information requests of stakeholders using consultations and
                    dialogs during the preparation of the report.
                </p>
                <p>44 companies have at least one of the system mechanisms of ensuring corporate transparency: they have
                    adopted corporate policies and / or standards of public reporting and disclosure, have created
                    functional responsibility, have introduced responsibility for public reporting in the KPI of top
                    management, have established specialized committees under the Boards of Directors, etc.

                        147 largest companies of the Russian Federation (15.4%) disclosed information in excess of
                        the requirements of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (III level of transparency) on
                        their own initiative.
                    </a>
                </li>
                <p>These companies inform about their impact on the ecology, economy and social sphere of the
                    regions of presence and (in some cases) disclose information about their strategies and business
                    models, but they do not use the International Integrated Reporting Framework.

                        197 companies from 956 surveyed (20.6%) disclosed only information required by the Central
                        Bank of the Russian Federation (IV level of transparency).

                </li>
                <p>As a rule, the public reporting statements of these companies were text documents without
                    infographics (diagrams, graphs, charts, maps, etc.). These reports were usually disseminated through
                    specialized disclosure sites (AK & M, AZIPI, Interfax, Prime-TASS, SKRIN).

                        Significant part of Russian largest companies, 550 out of 956 (57.5%), were opaque (V (zero)
                        transparency level).

                        14 companies from 956 surveyed (1.5%) did not publish their reporting in Russian (there is no

                    </a>
                </li>
                <p>These companies disclosed information about their activities in English only, being opaque to the
                    Russian-speaking audience. Most of them were Russian companies that operate only abroad, or
                    companies that are foreign residents, or companies that are interested only in foreign capital
                    markets (listed only on foreign exchanges).

                    <a href="transp_sectors">
                        The most transparent companies were those representing "Nuclear industry", "Electrical
                        Energy industry", "Telecommunications and Communications". Outsiders of corporate transparency
                        are the companies of the sectors "Information Technologies", "Media", "Wholesale Trade".
                    </a>

                <p>
                    2 out of 20 Nuclear Industry companies surveyed in 2017 disclosed reporting information in
                    accordance with the international standards and verified it (I level of transparency), 3 companies
                    published reporting in the form of an electronic annual report (Premium transparency level).
                    The “Nuclear Industry” is followed by the companies of the sectors “Electrical Energy industry” and
                    "Telecommunications and Communications" with a significant lag. The Transparency coefficient of the
                    Nuclear Industry reached 3.7 in 2017 (out of 6 possible), and the coefficients of these sectors were
                    2.67 and 2.44, respectively.
                </p>
                <p> The least transparent companies were the companies of the “Information Technologies” sector. The
                    Transparency coefficient of this sector was 1.07.

                        The exchanges are one of the institutional factors that stimulate the increase of corporate

                </li>
                <p>90% of companies listed exclusively on the Moscow Exchange (232 out of 257), correspond to Premium -
                    IV levels of transparency.
                    Companies listed on the Moscow Exchange and foreign exchanges (39 companies) are more transparent
                    than the companies listed only on the Moscow Exchange or only on foreign exchanges.
                    Among the companies with "double listing", 21 out of 39 prepare public reporting in accordance with
                    the International Integrated Reporting Framework. None of these companies carry out an independent
                    verification of public reporting.
                </p>
                <p> The number of non-listed companies was 699 from the entire list of companies surveyed.

                </li>
                <p>Since 2014, all companies have had the opportunity to self-determine – to become a PJSC or JSC, i.e.
                    public or non-public joint-stock company. Considering that public companies must be transparent,
                    only 295 out of 369 (80%) of the surveyed public companies having the legal form of OJSC or PJSC are
                    transparent (compliance with Premium – IV levels of transparency).

                <p>Non-public companies (state corporations, limited liability companies, federal state unitary
                    enterprises, etc.) do not satisfy the CBR's requirements for the public disclosure of information on
                    activities. However, a management decision to be open to stakeholders should have the key importance
                    in such companies. A total of 97 out of 574 (17%) non-public companies disclose non-financial
                    information about their activities. The rest of the companies do not publish any reporting and do
                    not care about their transparency.

                <p>Companies which have the 1st level of creditworthiness are still leaders in transparency among other
                    levels of creditworthiness, although they are located in the middle range (the Transparency
                    coefficient is 3.81 ). Companies of the 4th level of creditworthiness in 2017 are located in the
                    middle range in a low transparency range – 2.33. Companies at the 5th and lower level of
                    creditworthiness disclosed information in accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank of
                    the Russian Federation or do not disclose information at all.

                surveyed are non-transparent (V transparency level). 45 systemically important companies disclosed
                information only in accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (IV
                level of transparency). Another 5 systemically important companies prepare public reporting in English
