        <ol>
            <li>Survey of the reporting and official websites of companies:
                <ul>
                    <li>the first stage – 956 companies were surveyed. The companies which do not publish reports, or
                        publish reports only in a foreign language, or publish only the traditional annual reports
                        (under the requirements of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation) were not included in the
                        second stage;
                    </li>
                    <li>the second stage – 182 companies were surveyed based on the criteria. The basic survey
                        procedure – scanning of reports and corporate websites through the "information grid": criteria
                        / parameters / indicators (10 criteria, 95 parameters, 141 indicators for the companies which
                        used international reporting standards and 10 criteria, 23 parameters, 30 indicators – for the
                        companies which did not use international reporting standards, but disclosed information at the
                        level exceeding the requirements of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Spot-check the results of companies' survey by the Expert group (15% of companies were checked – 27
                companies).
            </li>
            <li>Verification (approval) of received data with the companies (48 companies took part in the verification
                of preliminary results).
            </li>
            <li>Audit for compliance of the conducted study with the methodology.</li>
            <li>Conclusions.</li>
