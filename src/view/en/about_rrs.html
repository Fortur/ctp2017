        <h1>About Russian Regional Network on Integrated Reporting</h1>
        <p>
            Regional networks are components of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) infrastructure.
            They exist in 14 countries (Australia, England, Brazil, Germany, India, Spain, Russia, Holland, Switzerland,
            the USA, Turkey, France, the South Africa and Japan).
        </p>
        <p> These networks are aimed at creating mechanisms for reporting quality support worldwide and at promoting
            integrated reporting. Regional networks interact with the IIRC and participate in the development and
            improvement of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. The Framework
            <IR> was released in December 2013. Regional networks are professional associations of people and
                organizations interested in the improvement of corporate reporting quality. These public associations
                include business representatives (companies and business associations), professional expert
                organizations, auditors and consultants, educational institutions, financial institutions (investment
                community), stock exchanges, government bodies and others.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Russian Regional Network on Integrated Reporting (RRN) was established in 2012. The meetings of the RRN
            Business Club are held; a number of projects are being implemented jointly with partners (Monthly News
            Digest, National Register of Integrated Reporting, Annual Study of Corporate Transparency of the Largest
            Russian Companies, etc.). The RRN has an official <a href="http://ir.org.ru">website</a>, where information related
            to the
            integrated reporting is being posted: news, the RRN and the IIRC event announcements, regulatory documents,
            methodological materials, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            During 2012-2017, the RRN Business Club organized 25 discussions of various topics related to the integrated
            reporting practices. Supported by ACCA Russia and JSC Moscow Exchange, the RRN organized the nomination
            “Best Integrated Report” in the framework of the XV Annual awards of annual reports of the Moscow Exchange
            in 2012. In April 2013, the RRN with the support of IIRC held a presentation of the International Integrated
            Reporting Framework draft for public discussion. The RRN organized several business visits of the IIRC
            representatives to Russia. Members of the Regional Network participate in the IIRC annual international
            conferences. In November 2014, the RRN officially presented the International Integrated Reporting Framework
            in Russia with the support of the IIRC. The RRN took part in the official translation of the Framework into
            Russian. In 2015, a cooperation agreement was signed between the International Integrated Reporting Council
            and the Da-Strategy Group, which provides support to the IIRC to implement integrated reporting practices in
            Russia. In January 2017, the meeting of the RRN Business Club with the participation of Henning Drager,
            representative of the International Integrated Reporting Council, took place in the ASE Group Project
            Management Center in Moscow. Henning Drager presented his vision of the quality of integrated reports
            prepared by Russian companies. In 2017, Russian proposals for the improvement of the International
            Integrated Reporting Framework, formed as a result of public discussions among stakeholders, were sent to
            the IIRC. The same year, the RRN began to make the assurance of the annual reports for compliance with the
            “IR” Framework. In November 2017, the results of the study and the rating of the annual reports for 2016
            were presented at the Annual Conference of the rating agency Expert RA (RAEX) “Annual Report: Leaders’
            Experience and New Standards”. The winners in the nomination “The best integrated annual report”,
            established with the support of the Russian Regional Network on Integrated Reporting, were awarded at the
            awards ceremony of the annual report winners.
