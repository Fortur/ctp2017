        <h2>Reported information assurance</h2>
        <h3>
            Types of assurance
        </h3>
        <p>
            Non-financial data shown in 16 out of 48 reports submitted by the biggest Russian companies (Premium, I and
            II transparency levels) has been verified by the companies’ experts and/or stakeholders (the financial data
            is subject to the certification under the acting law mandatory for all companies). Such a public
            certification confirms the reliability and importance of the information, its compliance with the request
            from the stakeholders.
        </p>
        <h3>The number of companies, using specific types of non-financial data assurance (2016-2017)
        </h3>
        <div id="zaver"></div>
        <p>
            16 companies used a third party audit to certify non-financial data in 2017. In the previous reporting
            period 14 companies used this type of certification of non-financial reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            15 companies organized special dialogues participated by the stakeholders and thus verified the disclosed
            information (the subjects of the certification were: the relevance and completeness of the data, the
            company’s ability to give a response to stakeholders’ requests).
        </p>
        <p>
            12 companies used a third party expert (such as RSPP, RRN) to certify the reported data. The number of such
            companies decreased. In 2016 18 companies used a third party expert to certify the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Internal audit and control divisions gave an opinion on the results of the internal audit of the public
            reporting process in 11 companies. The quantity of such companies was much bigger in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three companies simultaneously used all three methods of a third party certification (an independent
            professional auditor's report, a public / stakeholder report, as well as a public / expert report):
